## Contribution

Thank you for considering contributing to our project! To maintain a collaborative and productive environment, please adhere to the following guidelines when contributing:

1. Reporting Issues: If you encounter any bugs, inconsistencies, or have suggestions for improvements, please create an issue on GitHub. Clearly describe the problem or suggestion, along with steps to reproduce if applicable.

2. Submitting Pull Requests: Before starting work on a new feature or fix, please open an issue to discuss the proposed changes. This helps ensure that your contribution aligns with the project goals and prevents duplicate efforts.

3. Testing: Write tests for any new features or fixes you contribute. Ensure existing tests pass and write additional tests as necessary to cover edge cases.

4. Commit Messages: Write clear and descriptive commit messages that explain the purpose of each change. Use present-tense verbs and be concise but informative. Before commiting husky will automatically format, lint and test the code, please respect those pre-commit guidelines and make sure it passes.

If you want to help with the project, feel free to [open pull requests][1],
[submit issues or component proposals][2].
