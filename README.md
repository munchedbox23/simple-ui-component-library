# üëã Welcome

Welcome to Munchedbox component library, a collection of reusable UI components built with design code principles. Our library aims to provide developers with a set of consistent, customizable, and easy-to-use components to streamline the development process and ensure a cohesive user experience across applications.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Reusable Components**: Our library includes a variety of reusable components such as buttons, inputs, cards, and more, allowing you to quickly build interfaces without reinventing the wheel.
- **Customizable Styles**: Components are highly customizable, with support for theming, custom styles, and props to adapt to your project's specific needs.
- **Documentation and Examples**: Comprehensive documentation and live examples are provided for each component, making it easy to understand how to use and customize them in your projects.

# Installation

MunchedboxUI is available as an [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/munchedbox-ui).

## npm

To get started with our component library, simply install it via npm or yarn:

```bash
npm i munchedbox-ui
```

In order to have `munchedbox-ui` working properly, you'll also need
[styled-components üíÖ](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components),
this way you can use custom themes and get the best of the library.

## Usage

Import the component and start using the library

```bash

import { Button, Input } from "munchedbox-ui";

const ExampleComponent = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <Button variant="primary" size="md" type="button">Click me</Button>
      <Input
        autoComplete="current-password"
        type="password"
        name="password"
        placeholder="Enter your password"
        value={value}
        onChange={onChange}
        variant="rounded"
      />
    </div>
  );
};
```
